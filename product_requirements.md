1. Project Overview
Objective
Create a procedural terrain generator in Blender that uses wave function collapse (WFC) algorithms to generate varied, natural-looking landscapes with intelligent object placement.
Core Features

Procedural terrain generation with significant elevation variations
Smart placement of environmental objects (houses, trees, rocks)

2. Technical Architecture
Core Algorithm: Wave Function Collapse
The WFC algorithm works by:

Defining a set of possible terrain tiles/modules
Establishing rules for how tiles can connect
Starting from a random position and collapsing possibilities based on adjacent constraints
Propagating constraints through the system until all positions are determined

Implementation Strategy

Python scripting within Blender (addon format)
Integration with Blender's native geometry nodes for optimization (where appropriate)

3. Terrain Modules
Base Terrain Types

Mountain peaks
Slopes
Plateaus/flat areas
Valley floors
Riverbed channels
Coastal/shoreline configurations

Transition Rules
Each module must define connection rules with:

Height matching for seamless elevation changes
Terrain type blending parameters

4. Environmental Object System
Object Categories

Structures

Houses (single size and style to start))
Roads/paths


Natural Elements

Trees (different species by elevation/terrain)
Rock formations
Vegetation (grasses, shrubs)
Water features


Placement Constraints

Slope thresholds (buildings require flat areas)
Proximity rules (houses cluster, trees avoid houses)
Elevation dependencies (tree types change with height)
Orientation factors (buildings face roads/water)

5. Technical Implementation
Data Structures

Tile dictionary with connection rules
Constraint matrices for propagation
Object placement probability maps

Algorithm Stages

Initialization

Set grid parameters (resolution, size)
Load tile set and constraints
Define boundary conditions


Constraint Propagation

Iterative constraint application
Local entropy minimization
Backtracking for contradiction resolution


Mesh Generation

Tile-to-mesh conversion
Boundary smoothing
Normal calculation and refinement


Object Placement

Terrain analysis for placement suitability
Constraint checking
Instance scattering with variation


6. User Interface
Single button to generate, for now.
